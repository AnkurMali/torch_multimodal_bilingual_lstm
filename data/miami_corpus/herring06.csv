183,Gordo is sick too .
184,me dio una entrada de patadas anoche .
185,I don't know how many times he kicked me in the bed .
186,no .

188,so he must have been facing me the whole time .
189,no it was me .
190,it was me .
191,he was kicking me the whole time .
192,I didn't sleep very well either .

195,yeah I know you did .
196,you were snoring .

198,and quite loud I might add .
199,and Paco was snoring really loud too .
200,so anyway .
201,I'm gonna go drop that off at the motor home when I leave for the parish .
202,bueno de qué más quieres hablar ?
203,yesterday the principle called me in .
204,.
205,"she goes ""/."
206,I wanna talk to you before I speak to that teacher .
207,the one that has that problem .
208,yes .
209,"and and I go ""/."
210,I wanna //.
211,"she goes to me ""/."
212,I wanna speak to you before I talk to her because I want the union to be okay with this .
213,"and and I go ""/."
214,okay .
215,"and so I go to her ""/."
216,yeah well you know let me know about what's going on .
217,"and she goes ""/."
218,no I'm telling you what I'm planning to do because you know when she comes in she's probably gonna be upset or whatever .
219,she might come to you .
220,oh because she's coming back to work ?
221,okay .
222,she came back to work .
223,she came back to work .
224,yeah you know I was mentioning that you know people talk about the catholic church and how priests that molest children like get transfered /.
225,just get transfered from one place to another and the school system is doing the same thing .
226,but the school system is about just about the same category then .
227,because her dad is an attorney and her brother is an attorney .
228,so they're more scared of the lawsuit than they are of ethical things .
229,right they're more scared of the lawsuit from her the employee than the lawsuit from the parents .
230,yeah .
231,because the parents didn't do anything but the parents are more concerned and took them took the kids out .
232,imagine that's a free program .
233,you know and so anyhow she goes //.
234,"she had come to the principle had come to me a couple days ago and she goes ""/."
235,the person that you sent me an email and the resume do you know them personally ?
236,"and I go ""/."
237,truthfully no .
238,I know her boyfriend .
239,I know her via email but you know because you know we've gone back and forth .
240,then she is in a position where she wants to ...
241,who's this ?
242,la novia de ...
243,the manager of Payway .
244,oh okay yeah .
245,but he //.
246,right right right that she was in that school in //.
247,she's in Belair .
248,she's in Belair .
249,she's in fifth grade .
250,ESE .
251,well that's exactly what she needs over here .
252,pero ella no quiere traer a alguien .
253,tú sabes she goes .
254,so then tell them that they have to leave again .
255,no no .
256,because she's been working there less than three years .
257,she has to get that approved .
258,she you know it's the bureaucracy .
259,it takes a while .
260,"so she goes ""/."
261,I need the person that I have up there now .
262,no da la talla .
263,you know I mean I need to get rid of them .
264,and I need to bring in somebody else .
265,but with that other person they're already in the system .
266,so it's gonna take a long return .
267,even though they're in the system they're somewhere else so it has to get approved by the district the change .
268,even if /.
269,even the principals and stuff right ?
270,the principal //.
271,.
272,you remember what I went through okay .
273,and so she goes //.
274,because I had told her if she comes back what we need to do is don't put her don't put her in that classroom put her in a higher grade you know where kids can talk and kids can talk and kids can tell you exactly what's going on .
275,"and so she goes ""."
276,yeah but I think she's only certified for pre-K .
277,entonces estamos you know stuck with her .
278,"entonces she she goes to me ""/."
279,no but I looked up her stuff .
280,and she is K through six pre-K and K through six elementary .
281,well perfect .
282,and she is emotionally /.
283,put her with six grades six grades .
284,no no we don't have six grade .
285,oh that's right .
286,fifth grade .
287,put her with fifth grade students .
288,they will eat her alive .
289,then she'll leave .
290,of course eso es lo que tú quieres .
291,"le dije ""/."
292,la unión me va a botar porque yo no estoy .
293,she goes .
294,I go no .
295,eso pero es que ...
296,"yo le dije ""/."
297,eso es lo que tú tenías que hacer desde un principio .
298,yo sí pero es que yo no sabía que ella estaba you know certificada hasta quinto grado .
299,y ellos no miran nada los papeles y los expedientes de la gente ?
300,ay mi amor ella es una principal nueva .
301,.
302,you know ?
303,ella está ...
304,tú sabes .
305,she's great .
306,but she's new .
307,ella no se sabe todavía cómo access the things or and how to you know ...
308,she goes .
309,she asks people .
310,you know the person that gave her the position or whatever .
311,"and told her ""/."
312,listen look at what she's you know certified in .
313,because that's the first thing I had asked her .
314,what is she certified in ?
315,put her somewhere else .
316,but I guess she hadn't really done any until she you know somebody told her how to do it .
317,"entonces yo le dije ""/."
318,ahí sí que no puedo haber decir nada porque si es una decisión administrativa .
319,si a mí me cambian mañana de first grade a algo que yo no quiero .
320,quinto grado como me hizo la principal de la otra escuela .
321,eh she has every right to do so .
322,ahí it's her administrative decision that I would do best in this class .
323,whether I like it or not I mean they should take that into consideration .
324,but they don't have to .
325,but at any rate didn't they get somebody to replace her while she was gone ?
326,they had a sub .
327,and so what happened when this woman came back ?
328,well she requested not to have the people that you know made the allegations in the classroom .
329,"and she said ""/."
330,look I've nowhere else to put them .
331,so she obviously felt very uncomfortable working there .
332,good .
333,but then that's also something that our principal la principal me dijo como ella me había dicho que ella quería no estar con esta persona yo le voy a decir que mira como tú te sientes que piense que sea por ella .
334,mhm mhm .
335,"yo dije ""/."
336,perfecto .
337,así ella piensa que tú le estás haciendo un favor a ella .
338,y ella no va a dar la talla para eso .
339,porque ahí eh me lo dijo .
340,y todos esos chiquitos hablan .
341,oh yeah .
342,they're emotionally you know disabled .
343,pero le dicen hasta alma mía .
344,entonces por eso la otra no podía .
345,ESE is really really really difficult .
346,mhm mhm .
347,y más when you have you know kids that are the violent ones los que ...
348,ah entonces la cosa pasó que ayer durante ...
349,ella tenía una reunión .
350,like a CST it's a child study team .
351,so she was meeting with some parents and a counselor whatever .
352,so she wasn't in the classroom .
353,y entonces quién me vino a decir eso Dios mío ?
354,yo creo que fue Pili .
355,me vino a decir no que uno de los niños de la clase de ahí de ella lo encontraron en la calle descalzo running through the street .
356,entonces figúrate .
357,la principal les cayó a ellos .
358,"y dijo ""/."
359,pero qué pasó ?
360,entonces la principal fue adentro de la clase que you know to find out what happened .
361,how could this child just walk out ?
362,entonces there was like an electrical cord that didn't keep the door from closing all the way .
363,the child snuck out .
364,but this is from your school ?
365,yeah from her class .
366,where are you going ?
367,okay hurry up because I don't want you to leave your brother out there alone .
368,and the child snuck out .
369,so the principal went in there to try to see how could this happen and how to prevent it from happening again .
370,porque dice que two people that found ...
371,you know figúrate .
372,around the park people walk around .
373,.
374,you know so they found este es un niñito chiquitico sin zapatos .
375,because it was nap time .
376,corriendo por ahí .
377,entonces they brought him back dice que el señor was a Vietnam veteran .
378,y dice que estaba hasta llorando .
379,porque dice que le recordó a los niños en Vietnam you know running with the bombs and stuff and barefoot .
380,and you know dice que you know he was really traumatized with the whole thing .
381,figúrate it looks horrible on the school .
382,"entonces she goes ""/."
383,I went in there .
384,I was talking to the aids .
385,y tú sabes dónde estaba la dueña ?
386,I know she was in a meeting during that time .
387,"she goes ""/."
388,yeah but it's her classroom .
389,she estaba recogiendo como si no fuera nada con ella .
390,"she was ""/."
391,si es tu clase donde algo que pasó con tu estudiante tú no vas a estar ahí presente para que no ocurra de nuevo ?
392,y ésta es la misma que fue acusada ?
393,sí .
394,so she doesn't give a damn about the kids .
395,no she doesn't !
396,of course she doesn't !
397,y ésta no es la primera vez que le ha caído esto arriba .
398,en otra escuela o sea yo le había dicho ...
399,eventualmente ella se va a ir .
400,pero le va a tirar ese problema a otra persona .
401,ahora la cosa es que in fifth grade ESE ella está en el building de nosotros donde ella puede estar constantentemente vigilando .
402,y tiene personas al lado .
403,y ella seguro que le va a decir a las maestras de al lado que sean bien vigilantes you know .
404,y además de eso ella puede estar constantemente chequeándole los ...
405,because ella es un desastre .
406,she doesn't have plans .
407,you know she comes up with things al último minuto .
408,ella no toma eso en serio .
409,bueno .
410,"pero yo le dije ""/."
411,perfecto eso es lo perfecto .
412,porque yo eso es exactamente lo que yo le había dicho a la principal desde un principio .
413,"y yo le había dicho ""/."
414,tenemos que meterla en una clase para acá .
415,donde podemos estar ...
416,y ustedes tú sabes caminan you know en la clase lo que sea .
417,"entonces yo le dije ""/."
418,oye a mí no me van a botar .
419,nos van a botar para el carajo .
420,she was .
421,you know because sinceramente la unión es secundario .
422,para mí lo primero //.
423,es los niños .
424,es los niños .
425,absolutely .
426,y además eso es lo que dice el contrato .
427,que the primary purpose of the educators is the student .
428,so I'm going by the contract .
429,el que me diga ...
430,pero además ella no está haciendo nada ...
431,claro las dos sabemos que lo que queremos es que se vaya para el carajo pero ...
432,.
433,pero ahí sí que puede ella documentar .
434,porque ahí ella sí que tiene que tener las cosas bien organizadas .
435,yeah .
436,.
437,I think Katie is gonna start in a school in June .
438,she already resigned ?
439,mhm well I don't know if she's resigned .
440,but she hasn't signed the contract yet .
441,then she hasn't resigned .
442,but I think they started calling people down to sign their contracts on Thursday .
443,mhm .
444,I mean not Thursday yesterday .
445,yesterday was Wednesday .
446,but yeah yesterday .
447,no yesterday was Thursday .
448,yes .
449,no Wednesday .
450,I'm sorry .
451,they started calling people down .
452,so I imagine that they'll be calling her soon to go sign her contract .
453,and then the nun said that to see if she could be coming in you know at some point maybe for like a week or something .
454,just to see how things are .
455,and then probably start in June to try and get the ...
456,yo te digo sinceramente .
457,yo sé que Emily really wants to you know work there or whatever pero .
458,it may be better for her not to .
459,for you and for her .
460,porque qué pasa con las cosas de Pedrito ?
461,te vienen a ti .
462,qué va a pasar con las cosas de ella ?
463,they are gonna come to me .
464,right .
465,so .
466,no mi papá me lo dijo .
467,"mi papá me lo dijo ""/."
468,mira alégrate de que no le den trabajo ahí a Paul .
469,y esta chiquita bueno ya está ahí .
470,y Paul es muy hotheaded ?
471,no Paul uff .
472,a Paul lo van a botar de varios lugares si no se cuida .
473,"what I told her is ""/."
474,get your certification ...
475,exactly .
476,in social studies so that you can work at a public school .
477,"and then she told me ""/."
478,no Janet was saying that in Ferguson there is gonna be openings for six new teachers in every department .
479,"and I go ""/."
480,well there is your entry right there .
481,exactly .
482,you know .
483,there's always openings in .
484,"and she said ""/."
485,yeah but you know I don't wanna work in public schools .
486,"and I go ""/."
487,well you know what .
488,if you work in a public school you are gonna make more money than what I'm making right now .
489,okay .
490,"and I said ""/."
491,so go ahead .
492,and start doing that .
493,and the only way you are gonna get fired is if you do something to one of the kids .
494,but yes unless you have during the first thirty days or first day they have the option to you know if they see that you are really bad they can throw you out //.
495,come on .
496,within the first thirty days .
497,cuando estábamos en la clase el sábado .
498,was talking about that //.
499,he's such a jerk .
500,it was a teacher .
501,yeah I know .
502,I can't stand him .
503,that there was a teacher .
504,mhm .
505,that they had you know done a whole bunch of things .
506,.
507,I know exactly who they were talking about from you know from the school I was at before .
508,.
509,"and I go ""/."
510,did you get hired somewhere else ?
511,y esa maestra no hacía nada .
512,se sentaba en la clase tú sabes qué a comer y a organizar la cartera .
513,"entonces le preguntaba a los muchachos ""/."
514,are you sick ?
515,are you sick ?
516,"and if they were sick and they were out they would ask them ""."
517,what did you have ?
518,oh no I you know I had you know a stomach virus .
519,oh a stomach virus okay .
520,she would come back and say .
521,no she's sick .
522,and she she would ask for worker's compensation because she got the stomach virus from a kid in the class .
523,how do people like that get jobs ?
524,espérate .
525,that's not the worse .
526,y se robaba cosas .
527,ella yo la cogí una vez going through my desk y mirando cosas .
