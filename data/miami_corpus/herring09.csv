21,don't you think that's funny ?
22,is that that French teacher's artwork ?

24,I think so .
25,I saw another one of his on the wall the other day in the other side of the library .
26,I see .
27,but why the hell does he put the fricking ...
28,and the ornaments .
29,why does he have the periodic table on ?
30,I don't know .
31,that's ridiculous .
32,okay no he didn't send the money .
33,so I thought he wanted it today .
34,check my email for me ?
35,let's see if he wrote to me or something .
36,you know Matt has actually asked me about the fish .
37,what did he say ?
38,"well he asked me ""/."
39,how are your fish doing ?
40,and I told him that the puffer fish had died and ...
41,although that was a while back right .
42,he hadn't asked me you know .
43,yeah I know .
44,"and he said ""/."
45,oh well aren't those you know brackish water ?
46,the other guy had told him .
47,and then I told him about the boxfish that we got .
48,what did he say ?
49,that not to eat it !
50,.
51,he said that they have poisonous swim bladder .
52,oh we weren't gonna eat it .
53,you wanted to sell it .
54,yeah well but ...
55,okay .
56,I don't think you're ...
57,your book has shipped .
58,.
59,what ?
60,you like colon cleanse .
61,detoxify your body .
62,no I don't want that .
63,okay delete all of them except the ones from Six_gen_maxima the ones from two books for you .
64,baby so delete the other ones .
65,don't do that .
66,put delete all .
67,oh oh oh right right .
68,that's what I was planning /.
69,then take them out .
70,.
71,don't make fun of me .
72,and then that one again .
73,and the Amazon Marketplace purchase no you gotta delete that .
74,so everything else just leave those three things ?
75,yeah .
76,right let me see the one for the two books .
77,what's your tracking number ?
78,I don't think I got a tracking number .
79,because I paid for the cheapest eh shipping .
80,who cares ?
81,okay .
82,so put it to save .
83,no put it on the school .
84,put it move to school .
85,.
86,to F_I_U .
87,right here move to FIU .
88,alright and then check the other ones for me .
89,just click on it .
90,okay .
91,now someone show me ...
92,how we're fixing please .
93,I will do this good .
94,because I have no way of //.
95,I'm not gonna .
96,where's the home ?
97,it's a different person .
98,it's a different guy asking .
99,okay because I said //.
100,close it .
101,because somebody asking about how to wire the foglights in the car so that they come on on their own .
102,delete it ?
103,yep .
104,falta uno .
105,yeah clear them out .
106,because Jared says ...
107,maybe he doesn't know .
108,because maybe he just pays for everything .
109,maybe he doesn't know .
110,but he says that his installer guy got the windows to go up and down with the alarm .
111,I'm thinking that the installer just charged them for the modules .
112,so maybe they'll go up and down .
113,and he doesn't know .
114,what he's saying that it's without putting the modules .
115,I think that he's wrong .
116,because /.
117,hey oh on the ...
118,yeah because the thing is if they have one .
119,but they charge him a hell of a lot of money .
120,so it probably is included in the price .
121,alright .
122,okay .
123,he ...
124,he had to put it in this thing right ?
125,I can do it .
126,I can do it with this ones too .
127,so that means that there's a little connection that lets me do it with this key .
128,you wanna rewire or /.
129,okay he says that the guy moved the connection from this receiver to this receiver .
130,okay .
131,how the hell can you move it from one receiver to the other ?
132,because there's a receiver in the car that receives signals from this remote .
133,and then it makes the motors on the windows go down .
134,he just unplugged that from that receiver .
135,and plugged it into the auxiliary receiver on the module for this one .
136,because I can plug in whatever I want to it .
137,mhm .
138,the point is I need to find the cables I want to plug in .
139,and plug it in to this thing okay ?
140,that's what he said the guy did .
141,"everybody's like ""/."
142,oh I don't know how to do this !
143,impossible .
144,it's difficult .
145,not impossible that's doable .
146,you know what you do is you buy the modules fifty bucks each .
147,and they let you control .
148,and then add it onto this .
149,but then I would have to like run wires through each door .
150,and so it's a pain in the ass to install too .
151,besides the fact that it's you know the fifty bucks each .
152,then installation is even more .
153,so it's gonna be two hundred bucks ?
154,it's only let me see .
155,okay let me go down .
156,I thought they were going to keep windows .
157,I didn't know you could roll them back up //.
158,mine doesn't roll them back up !
159,but I don't know if somebody says so .
160,didn't Jared say he could do that too ?
161,yeah that's what I'm saying .
162,I didn't think he'd put a module .
163,because I can't put it up and down .
164,and the car just goes on .
165,and you know what I noticed ?
166,if I had the car ...
167,yeah ?
168,on it won't work any more .
169,the car has to be off for it to come now .
170,okay .
171,I guess it's not designed to work with a remote start .
172,do you want to delete that .
173,and then see what's in my junk .
174,you need to see my junk .
175,okay just delete it .
176,yeah click on the arrow next to the junk too .
177,there we go .
178,isn't that just intuitive the arrow ?
179,whatever no mine is better .
180,okay you can log me out .
181,good girl .
182,.
183,go to hell bitch .
184,why ?
185,let's go to Wales .
186,no .
187,do you think they have lots of whales in Wales ?
188,.
189,you're the corniest person in the entire fricking ...
190,oh I'm gonna ask him when he gets back .
191,because I think it's funny .
192,I think it's a funny name to call a country Wales .
193,.
194,what language do they speak over there ?
195,see if you know .
196,Welsh ?
197,no English .
198,no .
199,Flemish I think it is .
200,okay baby .
201,I think it's Flemish .
202,okay darling .
203,.
204,you know how many languages they got there ?
205,hello ?
206,is this another Family_Guy reference ?
207,no that's from Finding Nemo .
208,what she was speaking .
209,does that sound a little orca to you ?
210,oh my god .
211,.
212,okay .
213,.
214,I went to all the websites today .
215,I had so much I wanted to show you .
216,yeah you did everything except what you were supposed to do .
217,I know .
218,well I'm disappointed in you .
219,as usual .
220,and now the people in Wales are going to find out that I'm disappointed on my fiancé .
221,ah .
222,and they're gonna think that the students from FIU are not good students .
223,ya .
224,.
225,córtala .
226,well he said to keep talking .
227,but it doesn't say anywhere that we can't adjust the microphones .
228,.
229,oh my god .
230,anyways .
231,you're so annoying sometimes .
232,.
233,oh yeah .
234,I feel the same way you do about me ...
235,oh if we go over five thirty //.
236,oh oh she emailed me back .
237,the lady from Flamingo_Gardens .
238,and what did she say ?
239,she said that we can have more than a hundred guests .
240,but we're gonna have to pay for their chairs .
241,like bring in the chairs from an outside rental .
242,so that was the only reason why they said me a maximum of a hundred for the fricking chairs ?
243,yeah because they only had a hundred chairs !
244,oh come on !
245,that's not our problem .
246,you what ?
247,I'm just gonna leave the hundred chairs .
248,and the kids can sit on their parents laps .
249,or you know do whatever the hell .
250,oh and they don't close down the park if you have a wedding .
251,it's still open to the public .
252,I don't like that .
253,I don't like that either .
254,and if you're in the wedding party you can't go roam around the park and look at things .
255,unless you pay ?
256,unless you pay the twelve bucks .
257,oh it makes sense .
258,because you're going for free but ...
259,well I'm paying like two thousand bucks .
260,so then we can't as a wedding party go together looking at things unless we all pay ?
261,no .
262,unless everyone pays .
263,that's another dozen hundred dollars .
264,she said that you can get the fifteen or more group discount .
265,and it'll cost you less money .
266,that's so ridiculous over that amount of people .
267,hey that's why she said twelve I think instead of ...
268,yeah but I /.
269,because with the group discount you get like twelve dollars for adults .
270,versus seventeen it's a huge difference .
271,it's over a hundred dollars less .
272,but I don't wanna pay twelve hundred dollars for people to go look at birds .
273,in my yeah it's our wedding day .
274,they gonna look at us .
275,no no no I mean if they wanna walk around they can go on their own .
276,and pay ?
277,I'm not gonna yeah .
278,well anyways I just ...
279,maybe because the last time we went it was right after the Eragon .
280,and it was all messed up .
281,but I really /.
282,I think by now it should be fixed .
283,we need to go back and see .
284,look how pretty the gazebo looks .
285,did you see it ?
286,the gazebo ?
287,oh my god .

290,.
291,.
292,ah gazebo look it up !
293,mhm it's from the teacher reference .
294,ignore him .
295,okay so Flamingo_Gardens .
296,why are you talking to your shirt ?
297,.
298,.
299,I ...
300,because I don't want them to think you're crazy or something .

332,I wonder if she settled ?
333,and it didn't go to the website .
334,I wonder what ever happened to her .
335,why don't you go email her .
336,see what she says .
337,because I ...
338,she says she'll miss me .
339,well I don't have her ...

362,so they started putting ads and stuff on it right .
363,"and then they're like ""/."
364,good now you have to pay to use it .
365,so people stopped using it .
366,yeah .

368,some guy just hacked it and took out all the ...
369,yeah .
370,two thousand five they closed down the network .
371,because I think they got sued by the real wow .
372,they got ...
373,I said sued !
374,because of the whole Kazaa .
375,they got sued .
376,they got sued by the Kazaa .
377,the website's not working .
378,Flamingo_Gardens is you sure it's dot-org not dot-com ?

446,my mom my mom was getting annoyed right .
447,I mean first of all she hates the dog .

466,Roger has him trained for hunting .
467,yeah but you can train him for hunting and be nice to people .
468,hunting animals not people .
469,yeah well they haven't socialized him .
470,because the girls are scared of him .
471,he doesn't get along with other dogs .
472,he's just a little menace .
473,like Dennis ?
474,oh my god okay .
475,I did not like that movie you know .
476,it's based on a cartoon strip in a cartoon show .

527,hm .
528,he doesn't feel a thing .
529,but /.
530,and then ...
531,why is your mother torturing this very expensive dog that her employers own ?
532,because it was trying to eat the parrot .
533,yeah but it's not ...
534,and it turns out that he ate the parrot .
535,but it's not your mother's responsibility to protect the parrot .
536,yet is her responsibility to not hurt the dog which cost a thousand something dollars .
537,.
538,and it's Roger's prize possession right now .
539,my mom was saying that she wishes that the dog would just die .
540,which she's gonna get fired .

547,.
548,my mom said that they had to take him to the vet .
549,and like they put like they give him I guess an enema .
550,why ?
551,and pumped his stomach .
552,why ?
553,because of the bones of the parrot inside of him .
554,so what is Roger gonna do ?
555,buy a new parrot ?
556,I guess !
557,and hope that she doesn't realize .

565,so what ?
566,and the thing opened ?
567,and the parrot came out ?
568,and the dog ate the parrot .
569,so then he wasn't that strong if just /.
570,no no no no because the thing is it's ...
571,okay it's like the two part ones where you have the base .
572,and then you have I guess a cage on top which is I guess in the shape of a canopy .
573,yeah no on the bottom it's open .
574,so if you knock it off uhhuh .
575,ah it's a stupid piece of crap then .
576,so the the dog knocked it over .
577,and the parrot was not too bright .
578,those parrots have their wings clipped most of the time .
579,oh that's right they can't fly .
580,yeah they can't fly .
581,I was gonna say they can't swim !
582,they flew they they would've gone .
583,well that sucks .
584,yeah .
585,you know what I was thinking ?
586,my mom says that Jock is probably next .
587,my mom says that no she said that she wishes that he would eat Jock .
588,because if he eats Jock they'll get rid of the dog .
589,no but no /.
590,because they all attached to Jock .
591,come on that's a beautiful freaking macaw man .
592,they shouldn't let him .
593,he should go .
594,you know you tell Roger he buys me a pellet gun and I'll shoot his dog .
595,.
596,I'll do the dirty job .
597,.
598,he's not gonna get rid of it .
599,he loves the dog .
600,or he gives me his Mercedes and I'll run the dog over with his own car .
601,so what do you think of the gazebo ?
602,I don't even remember it .
603,it's not a bad looking gazebo but ...
604,oh my god stop calling it that .
605,ah I gotta exploit Michael .
606,okay .
607,so yeah and then they have the rates yeah .
608,.
609,if they can do the gazebo .
610,and then the garden area .
611,"it says ""/."
612,for use during ceremonies .
613,that's what I wanted to use for the actual reception .
614,I don't wanna use the barbecue pavilion .
615,that's like retarded .
616,after five thirty it pays seventy five dollars an hour ?
617,hm ?
618,so then that means we're gonna be done before five thirty with our wedding ?
619,our ceremony and everything ?
620,hopefully if you want to .
621,if not no .
622,well well were you planning on paying extra per hour then ?
623,no I was planning on being done by then .
624,so but what happened to the whole sunset and all that stuff ?
625,costs too much money .
626,.
627,wait from five thirty six thirty seven thirty eight thirty it'll be like three hundred bucks .
628,eight thirty for what babe ?
629,the sunset goes on around eight .
630,no get it .
631,when are we getting married ?
632,when are we getting married ?
633,.
634,in ...
635,daylight savings time or not ?
636,oh my god yeah .
637,I wanna do it like February or March .
638,so we'll be able to like just have to pay one hour extra .
639,that's true .
640,and these people don't have anything about you can't use you know candles or you can't use you know the little sparklers .
641,so you can do the sparkler thing .
642,can we throw rice ?
643,no you can't /.
644,it's a bird park you get it ?
645,it's funny .
646,yes it's a sanctuary yeah .
647,so I'm sure rice is off limits .
648,the only thing that they have that they specifically say no to is the alcohol .
649,well good I'm sure if we just pass out drugs then people won't complain about not having alcohol .
650,.
651,did they mention anything about drugs ?
652,no Luke .
653,okay so we can have drugs then !
654,that's how we do it down here .
655,so what do you think of Flamingo_Garden ?
656,I don't know .
657,we'll have to see it again because I just ...
658,which is why ...
659,.
660,I think we should go with our families .
661,no babe for that we can just you and me .
662,it counts for my class .
663,it counts .
664,I still don't see why we have to bring another twenty five people .
665,I would like my parents to go .
666,because they have never been to that park .
667,and it's really lovely .
668,yeah that's a whole different story .
669,but it has nothing to do with me seeing it to consider whether or not I want it to be a venue for my wedding .
670,yeah but we can kill two birds with one stone .
671,and spend some time with the family .
672,baby !
673,okay that is messed up .
674,and go look ...
675,we're going to a bird sanctuary to kill two birds with one stone !
676,shut the fuck up .
677,.
678,.
679,yeah oh now I remember what I was going to ask you .
680,do you think when they are listening to these recordings that they're going to listen to both of us at the same time ?
681,or is it just me just talking one crap and you're talking a completely different crap individually ?
682,unless they put it together it doesn't really make much sense does it ?
683,think about it .
684,.
685,think about it !
686,"if it's just you saying every so often ""/."
687,ay Jesu Cristo .
688,shut the fuck up shut the fuck ...
689,.
690,yeah half a page of shut the fuck up .
691,.
692,every so often .
693,.
694,all on your own .
695,without any input from me it sounds kind of weird .
696,we don't need wedding counseling right or marriage counseling ?
697,no babe not yet we're not married yet .
698,we're perfectly fine .
699,we're not married yet .
700,that's one of the suggestions on one of those websites to get counseling before you're married .
701,before ?
702,yeah .
703,like if necessary .
704,we should get a prenup .
705,I'm like what the fuck if you're getting married you shouldn't be needing counseling .
706,we should get a prenup .
707,we're not getting a prenup .
708,yes we are .
709,that's absurd .
710,why babe ?
711,I wanna make sure when you leave me that I get ninety per cent of your money .
712,.
713,we'll make it that if you're the one who makes it ...
714,oh yeah ninety per cent of zero .
715,what is that ?
716,no baby because you're gonna make it big .
717,if you make it big I get ninety per cent of your earnings .
718,oh really .
719,make it big in what ?
720,in history ?
721,sure maybe you'll be the one to discover the you know Jesus .
722,stop no don't do that !
723,why ?
724,sorry .
725,maybe you .
726,put it away .
727,it scares me .
728,maybe you'll be the one to discover Jesus .
729,we could save so much money if we only had twenty guests .
730,I know .
731,my mom your mom ...
732,the ceremony for up to twenty guests two hundred and fifty dollars that's it .
733,I have to email them about the reception if we can meet them in the garden area in front .
734,Ray_Home verandah .
735,you know what we should do it in ?
736,the Ray_Home verandah says canopy of live oak surrounding the historic home .
737,so would that imply that the thing would be outside the reception ?
738,okay that sounds good .
739,yeah babe but I don't think we're gonna fit a bunch of people in there .
740,that's a home .
741,it's a house .
742,no no no because I wanted outdoor .
743,remember the whole tea thing I wanted to be outdoors .
744,not indoors .
745,yeah .
746,I'm just thinking all those birds and all those trees and a lot of pooping on our heads .
747,we're gonna have tents ?
748,I don't think we'll need it .
749,if they okay I'll wear a white tuxedo there you go .
750,.
751,because if they poop on my .
752,you're not wearing a tuxedo .
753,I'm not ?
754,I don't want you to .
755,I want it to be really casual .
756,all right .
757,so like I was thinking a nice ...
758,guayabera ?
759,I dunno a tan suit or something like the tan ...
760,yo quiero Taco_Bell .
761,with the pink shirt or something really relaxed .
762,.
763,.
764,now I'm making all these and these concessions right .
765,.
766,what concession do I have to make ?
767,take it seriously .
768,I am .
769,I'm taking it /.
770,no because of the whole religion thing .
771,oh yeah no baby exactly .
772,but that's why we're not doing it by the church .
773,yeah but we're still having my uncle who's a pastor .
774,who is gonna marry us .
775,okay well make sure you tell him not to do all of that crazy you know voodoo Bible stuff .
776,he the Christian church doesn't do the whole you know use the blood of Christ and all that crap he's ...
777,I don't want any reading from the Bible .
778,I don't /.
779,I do want some .
780,and ...
781,you said Corinthians only .
782,well ...
783,that's it .
784,that's all I conceded to .
785,.
786,because it's romantic .
787,"I don't want anything to do with ""/."
788,God brought you here and God ...
789,because I don't believe in that .
790,and so how am I /.
791,well you know what I need a little bit of if he asks for a little bit of liberty in that for you to respect it .
792,.
793,and well I suppose he's also gonna do it in Spanish ?
794,I don't know .
795,well considering /.
796,were you planning on the whole wedding being in Spanish and not telling me until the day of ?
797,the invitations so far as I have imagined them are in English .
798,but then I was thinking everyone in the fucking family speaks Spanish .
799,what the fuck are we gonna do ?
800,are we gonna send everyone who speaks Spanish an English invitation ?
801,well babe here's the thing .
802,they're in America .
803,they need to get with the fricking program .
804,I am not going to do /.
805,Luke !
806,I am not going to do two language invitations .
807,because then you're paying two different companies to do ...
808,no pero doing it in Spanish ...
809,no because there's some people like ...
810,who ?
811,Jessie and Davy .
812,who got my fifteenth invitation in Spanish and knew how to get there .
813,you know if the directions are in numbers .
814,I mean it's not like you know uno dos tres cuatro .
815,you know oh .
816,no .
817,does she mean one two three four ?
818,oh my god .
819,well maybe because some of them they actually write the fricking numbers out .
820,put the numbers in numbers .
821,how about that ?
822,amore .
823,en números .
824,no because I seen some of them that you know they write out the numbers .
825,you know I didn't wanna do it in Spanish .
826,but it makes more sense .
827,being it's more sensitive to our family situation .
828,but then again are we doing this for /.
829,because I wanted to do that introduction on the top .
830,are we gonna do this for our family or for us ?
831,well obviously it's not for us !
832,are you and I getting married ?
833,or is the family getting a party thrown ?
834,I mean are we throwing a party for the fricking family or for you and me ?
835,you know I don't wanna do it in Spanish .
836,because I don't just don't like it .
837,you like to say te amo .
838,that's pretty much the only thing I'll give .
839,just because you see it as special .
840,I say I love you .
841,and I mean it as passionately as you mean te amo .
842,it doesn't have the same connotation you know .
843,.
844,te amo .
845,te quiero .
846,but I don't wanna do ...
847,this is the gazebo thing .
848,look the layout .
849,como es en pobreza y en .
850,no no no no but okay I'm not gonna ...
851,the vows are something personal .
852,no one it doesn't matter if the whole fucking ceremony is in English .
853,stop with the bad words .
854,sorry I'm gone somewhere .
855,they're gonna go assuming that all they teach us here is fricking bad words .
856,because you said that nasty word which I don't say .
857,.
858,oh you little ...
859,.
860,.
861,mira .
862,you said it several times already .
863,and it's inappropriate for a petite little lady like yourself .
864,okay sweetheart .
865,thank you .
866,it's uncouth .
867,.
868,and you are so refined .
869,okay .
870,my lady .
871,this is the layout of the gazebo .
872,it's not .
873,and this will be like el camino .
874,and then you have a little /.
875,you know there was a pick up truck called Chevrolet Camino ?
876,we would set up the chairs .
877,there's also one called Nova .
878,yeah I know .
879,you know supernova that's sounds like an English word .
880,but el Camino I mean that's like wow out there .
881,okay .
882,okay .
883,so this would be like the walkway .
884,and then you have the different rows of ...
885,where is it whoops .
886,hold on .
887,this thing fell .
888,okay .
889,the different rows of the chairs .
890,I found this website that does the fans right .
891,the but like okay .
892,there are rectangular /.
893,why don't we just put like you know one fan at the end of each row blowing down ?
894,no the fans are the paper fans .
895,I know .
896,but why don't we do an electric fan that'll actually do it quickly .
897,okay .
898,they're rectangular .
899,okay traditionally what you do is that you give out a program at the ceremony .
900,uhhuh .
901,that basically says our names the maid of honour the best man .
902,and a small little /.
903,from my personal experience that is what I've used as a fan the program .
904,I bend it .
905,and I kind of fan myself with it !
906,okay but when I'm doing that /.
907,is that's not our idea right ?
908,no .
909,oh .
910,okay .
911,could we save money by putting the program onto the face of ?
912,this is what I'm trying to tell you !
913,okay go .
914,they have them on a couple websites where it's a rectangular thick card stock paper fan .
915,oh yeah .
916,and then it has a cute little design on there .
917,I know .
918,little flowers and stuff .
919,and you can put the actual program on it .
920,and you it has the program on it .
921,that's cool man .
922,so it's like a little /.
923,what let's take it one step forward then once it's that over .
924,can you have it ?
925,those cost more money .
926,ah .
927,this I can get like ...
928,yeah but if that's like a fricking piece of cardboard and a dental dam or whatever .
929,yeah and it'll also be about a dollar each .
930,a dental thing ah what is it called ?
931,yeah and a whatever .
932,the little stick .
933,these are about a dollar each .
934,yeah because it's gotta be thick stock .
935,or whatever //.
936,the fans that open up .
937,they have these silk ones .
938,they have paper ones .
939,they have the little wooden ones all of them .
940,silk is cool .
941,the cheapest one is a dollar fifty each .
942,in all the websites I've looked at .
943,which is why I wanted you to take me to that Chinese store .
944,but but that dollar fifty would that allow you to put enough text to put the whole frigging thing ?
945,no !
946,the whole program ?
947,it none of them allow you to put the program on it .
948,wow .
949,you would have to print it out separately and glue it on or something .
950,cool .
951,or we can do programs printed out and rolled up into little thingies .
952,and then have the fans on top of it .
953,because you have //.
954,I think it would be really mean of us to have an outdoor wedding and not offer fans .
955,for the people .
956,well that's why we do it during the cold season .
957,"so that and we tell everybody ""/."
958,bring your own sweaters !
959,oh because I wanna have a spring wedding .
960,I don't wanna have a winter wedding .
961,I don't wanna have a summer wedding .
962,I like spring .
963,well why don't we do it on a day of spring where the temperatures will be around seventy sixty five degrees ?
964,sixty five too cold .
965,no not once you have all that crap that you're gonna have on you babe ?
966,I'm not getting a huge poofy dress Luke !
967,okay then we'll move it up to seventy degrees .
968,why don't we do it on a day that's seventy degrees out ?
969,there's there'll be a lot of old people .
970,old people still can't handle it .
971,can't handle what ?
972,the heat .
973,the temperature it's not good for old people .
974,seventy degrees is not good for old people what the hell is that ?
975,you wait wait till you're old you know .
976,they have the perfect temperature they need .
977,how are there so many old people here in Florida ?
978,isn't this like the golfing capital of the world or something for old farts to come ?
979,I'm worried we can't anticipate whether or not it's gonna be seventy degrees or eighty degrees or ninety degrees .
980,are you saying this because of your parents ?
981,no my parents don't even know about this idea .
982,and no they're not that old thank you .
983,well they're older than mine !
984,oh my god .
985,well sweetheart I like the idea .
986,yeah and my parents are older than yours .
987,and yet my mom can do more than your mom can do .
988,because your mom is in pain twenty four seven .
989,well you know why ?
990,when my mom was your was your mom's age my mom could do anything .
991,you know why ?
992,because your mom's a vieja .
993,no because my mother is a fully developed woman .
994,your mother is a little midget with no meat on her bones .
995,no meat on her bones ?
996,are you ignoring like two hundred pounds of meat or what ?
997,I don't know .
998,because my mother has a body .
999,she has butt .
1000,she has boobs .
1001,your mum is she looks like a square .
1002,and a small square at that .
1003,a little stubby !
1004,my mom ...
1005,yeah babe fifty years ago in her time maybe she was hot .
1006,now she's not .
1007,you know same thing about your dad .
1008,maybe a hundred years ago he was hot .
1009,but now he just looks like a freaking old you know .
1010,fuck you .
1011,like the crypt keeper .
1012,five years older than the crypt keeper .
1013,mira .
1014,vas a buscar problema .
1015,that's that's the house by the way .
1016,and they have in the back supposedly .
1017,I haven't seen it .
1018,I remember .
1019,we saw it in person .
1020,but it was after the hurricane .
1021,yeah I know .
1022,so it looked like shit .
1023,we didn't go in .
1024,well the whole park was ...
1025,they have tours .
1026,we can go take a tour of the house .
1027,the whole park was destroyed when we went .
1028,I really wanna go back .
1029,I really wanted to go back with my parents and the girls .
1030,that'd be nice .
1031,have a little day out .
1032,and enjoy the park .
1033,then the ...
1034,I just don't even want to look at it .
1035,the Spanish monastery anymore .
1036,no it's just .
1037,I don't really wanna do it in the Spanish monastery .
1038,I was disappointed when I went there .
1039,they're .
1040,they're too uptight .
1041,and the place is so small and gloomy .
1042,they were too uptight .
1043,and then the whole place looks too small .
1044,it looks gloomy .
1045,it doesn't even look like a happy place .
1046,.
1047,babe if you want a happy place we'll get married in McDonalds .
1048,come on .
1049,you ever gone to one of the little play thingies and been gloomy ?
1050,it's beautiful .
1051,no babe .
1052,it's cheerful outside .
1053,and there was the other place what was it ?
1054,I'm gonna go to my email .
1055,let me find it .
1056,there he is .
1057,the other place ...
1058,it was that house in Little_Havana .
