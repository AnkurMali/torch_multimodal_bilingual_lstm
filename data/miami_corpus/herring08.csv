127,it was very minor what they told me I had to change .
128,what ?
129,centering a page .
130,margins a no sé qué on the appendix .
131,but you see what I'm saying is they should not give you because they've asked you to format a thousand different ways .
132,they should have one person at the end of the process once everything's approved doing the formatting .
133,okay you need to change this and this .
134,that's what the college //.
135,so should have one person in charge of formatting .
136,in the college of education they hire Mrs_Dr_Blap to do that .

150,when have they ever decided to play football here ?
151,two weeks ago .
152,when we had the music playing .

156,did you saw that orange Gatorade thing from when you're coaching ?
157,yeah .
158,we should every now and then have /.
159,why what's wrong with Mary ?
160,que these kids need to drink .
161,and they probably go into Mary's house I think all the time and drink .
162,we need to be supplying them with drinks .
163,when I was a kid you know we used to do ?
164,we used to get the hose and drink from the hose .
165,if they're too prissy to drink from the hose then let them go inside and get drinks .
166,okay they have not /.

180,mulch do you think I should ?
181,I have two bags of mulch I can lay .

221,yeah when I got in the door was unlocked and how weird .
222,but wasn't she supposed to be out ?
223,I thought everybody was gonna be out today .
224,that's what I had heard that everybody was out .
225,es que she gave everybody the day off except for herself /.
226,y ...
227,which is fine .
228,we made a lot of progress .
229,y cómo te fue el día ?
230,all day .
231,the morning was getting ready for the meeting .
232,basically it was CC's integrates .
233,I gave her the ideas .
234,pero she ...
235,modified them .
236,complicated them .
237,she C_C_ed them .
238,if that means complicate then yeah .
239,you know these are meant to be for teacher assistants and they're supposed to be nonthreatening lowprep you know emphasizing /.
240,and I had told her you know do something on conservation because there's water ...
241,I given her .
242,long story short it was very complicated so ...
243,I had already gone through them because supposedly that's what I was gonna do yesterday .
244,so then in the morning I went through them I made copies of everything and then I also gave /.
245,for example one of the reviewers had recommended a book in the lesson of displacement where the water is displaced ...
246,mhm .
247,called the crow and the pitcher .
248,it's an Aesop fable .

255,it has an A .
256,Aesop's fables .
257,A Aesop .
258,Aesop's fable .
259,you know the crow and the pitcher ?
260,anyway it has to do with a crow who wants to drink some water from a pitcher .
261,but his beak doesn't go inside .
262,so he needs putting little stones in until the water rises enough he can drink it .
263,and the thing is using your wit to get whatever .
264,but it's a lesson on displacement which is exactly the second lesson .
265,Ruby used it .
266,so I showed .
267,and you went to work with those shoes ?
268,I thought I was alone .
269,and did she say anything ?
270,no pero Rosa las chancletas .
