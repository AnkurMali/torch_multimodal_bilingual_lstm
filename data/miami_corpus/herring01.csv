578,and I have to give her fifteen drops of some fluid thing .
579,.
580,he //.
581,I told him what happened .
582,he started making a noise .
583,"I'm like ""/."
584,yes that is exactly it .
585,and so then he did an x-ray out of her lungs .
586,"and he asked me he's like ""/."
587,has she been in an accident or something ?
588,I'm like no .
589,"he's like ""/."
590,has she you know gone into the pool ?
591,I guess asking me if she's swallowed water or something .
592,"I'm like no I'm like ""/."
593,she hates the water .
594,I mean god even when I bathe her you know it's like no .
595,so I don't know if maybe it's from before that she's had it .
596,and she's accumulating sitting there .
597,I mean I don't know .
598,maybe one day when I took her to the beach .
599,she might have swallowed some water accidentally //.
600,I mean I don't know where it came from .
601,so he told me to ...
602,huh ?
603,"no no no no I'm like ""/."
604,it's curable ?
605,it's treatable ?
606,"he's like ""/."
607,oh yeah yeah yeah yeah .
608,"he's like ""/."
609,it's just that her ...
610,he showed me the x-ray .
611,it's like a part of her lung //.
612,it's so fascinating .
613,like I would want to be a vet except I don't like biology .
614,oh and they had to put a little cat to sleep today .
615,I'll tell you about that later .
616,this is so sad .
617,oy .
618,uhuh this is why I couldn't be a vet .
619,anyways .
620,no he showed me a part of her lungs that in the x-ray they came out black .
621,like they were just very dark because they were swollen .
622,"and he's like ""/."
623,you see it's like they shouldn't be that dark .
624,they should be more like this .
625,and he compared it to like a lighter gray area in her lung .
626,"so he's like ""/."
627,well we'll put her on antibiotics .
628,and then come back in two weeks .
629,so ...
630,"he's like you know ""/."
631,take the biotics because her lungs are swollen .
632,I guess her lungs are swollen and making her cough .
633,and so then ...
634,what her lungs being swollen ?
635,I don't know .
636,I didn't ask him .
637,he's not sure what it is .
638,he told me to give her the medication .
639,and then see if it happens in two weeks .
640,and then if it continues in two weeks then he'll see you know what else it could be .
641,so ...
642,he gave her a shot today so I'm not going to give her any medication until tomorrow .
643,so she's in my room right now .
644,she's sleeping because she's drowsy and stuff .
645,and he cleaned her glands .
646,and then I told him about the flea thing .
647,he gave me some pills for the fleas .
648,it's a pill .
649,you give her one pill every ten days and it kills the fleas within thirty minutes of her taking the pills .
650,so I gave her the pill right when I got home .
651,and he just told me just to you know not to bathe her now .
652,but to you know just clean the house or whatever like you know .
653,the usual .
654,he told me you've got nothing to worry about obviously .
655,so other than that she's okay .
656,I don't know .
657,I didn't ask him .
658,he knew what it was .
659,he knew what medication to give her .
660,so I'm sure he must be familiar with whatever it is .
661,he's just asked me where it came from .
662,and I told him I didn't know so ...
663,because I didn't know I guess he couldn't really ...
664,he couldn't assume where it came from so .
665,the coughing .
666,"yeah he's like ""/."
667,it's probably because her lungs are swollen .
668,he told me .
669,so he's like ...
670,I didn't tell him about the sneezing .
671,the sneezing I really think is because she hits her nose .
672,I mean when I hit my nose I sneeze .
673,so she's always launching herself into the carpet .
674,and hitting herself with a paw .
675,and I just think it has to do with that .
676,but I'll mention it .
677,if it continues like severely then I'll tell him in two weeks when I see him .
678,he took her temperature .
679,she has she had a hundred and two of temperature .
680,her normal temperature is one oh one .
681,so it was a little bit high .
682,so ...
683,but he said it wasn't a fever or anything .
684,and she gained like two pounds .
685,so ...
686,okay what are we gonna do ?
687,four maybe ?
688,okay .
689,okay bye .
690,what are you going to do afterwards ?
691,I dunno .
692,I have to finish a drawing for my parents .
693,and so yesterday Michael and I //.
694,he started telling me like .
695,he sketched over what I need to put in the drawings .
696,so but I need him to help me draw detail .
697,because the wall's being constructed .
698,uhhuh .
699,like I know like the foundations and the footings .
700,but I don't know the actual construction .
701,and what the materials are called .
702,and how to technically put them in the drawings .
703,so he does obviously .
704,mhm .
705,so I have to sit with him and do it .
706,my parents are like asking me and bothering me about it .
707,I'm like ...
708,I understand .
709,"but it's like ""/."
710,look like I have things to do .
711,you know last weekend like I had to take work home for my boss .
712,yeah .

714,so it's like don't assume that I have every weekend all the time to do it you know .
715,then I have that exam to study for .
716,so ugh .
717,I wanted to go to ...
718,what are we going to do afterwards ?

721,well I have to go to Old_Navy to get Carolina and Carolina's daughter something ...
722,mhm .
723,for tomorrow so ...
724,I figure I'll find something there in the sale .
725,because I just spent a hundred and forty dollars on the vet .
726,so I have no money .
727,uhhuh .
728,later I have to go with Sarah to buy something for one of our friend's birthdays that's tonight .

738,alright .
739,"so I'm like ""/."

744,"so I'm like ""/."
745,I'll take work home .
746,I didn't tell them that .
747,yeah .
748,so on Monday I won't be behind .
749,do they pay you more for taking work home or no ?
750,no .
751,and I don't tell them what I do .
752,because ...
753,yeah .
754,se la hace costumbre .
755,yeah .
756,.
757,and they'll expect me to do it every weekend or something .
758,yeah .
759,and I think she's kinda noticing that all of us are just fed up with the whole situation .
760,who the lady Raquel ?
761,mhm .
762,and that we're sick of it .
763,there's so much drama .
764,you don't need much contact with all this stress and deadlines .
765,we don't need it .
766,you don't need additional ...
767,no .
768,stress .
769,I mean the job's stressful enough .
770,I don't need to add to it .
771,and that's what she does .
772,we fell down on like review like two weeks ago .
773,I guess she's asking for our bonuses .
774,they don't do that thing where you can review her ?
775,I think we do .
776,I don't know when they're gonna you know cuando nos yeah .
777,it could be anonymous .
778,no and it's not anonymous .
779,well she's a bitch .
780,.
781,and she's bipolar .
782,did the guy leave that guy that she was ...
783,no he's still there !
784,I thought he was leaving to New_York you said or something .
785,they haven't mentioned it again .
786,I don't know .
787,sometimes I think that it would be best .
788,but sometimes I think it wouldn't .
789,because when he's around she's like you know ...
790,in a better mood ?
791,yeah she doesn't bother us .
792,she's not like on our back every five minutes .
793,is it done yet ?
794,that's annoying .
795,thank god it wasn't me .
796,we had our morning meeting whatever .
797,we went to the office Mari //.
798,and Maricarmen had to do you know .
799,she had an assignment that day .
800,and no habían pasado diez minutos .
801,and she calls .
802,"and she's like ""/."
803,ya les puedo ver ?
804,"Maricarmen was like ""/."
805,acabo de comenzar .
806,they don't know what it's like to do the work .
807,that's why they ask so much and they ...
808,like it happens to me sometimes at work it's like .
809,you know they give me something .
810,they don't even .
811,sometimes they don't understand that it's a lot of coordinating and a lot of you know flipping back and forth .
812,"and they're like ""/."
813,oh can you have it by tomorrow ?
814,"and I'm like ""/."
815,no !
816,you know I can try .
817,but I'm not gonna lie to you and tell you that it's possible .
818,mhm .
819,because well there's just me alone .
820,and it's because they maybe once did it .
821,or now they forgot you know that it takes so long how time consuming it is .
822,or it turns out they've never done it so ...
823,"Leticia told her one day ""/."
824,one day you should just sit with one of us .
825,and you know sit down .
826,and actually take your time .
827,and see how long it takes to draw something .
828,that's the only problem with my boss .
829,she's ...
830,the people that actually the parties that I work with the school parties my team ...
831,mhm .
832,they're really good .
833,because like I had to do something for like the bathrooms right .
834,mhm .
835,and I had to select tiles .
836,and yes it sounds very easy .
837,but it's a lot of time consuming .
838,because ...
839,yeah .
840,it's very time consuming because they give you a board with different price ranges .
841,.
842,there's group one two three and four and five .
843,five being the most expensive .
844,mhm .
845,"and then in the specs like which is part of your contract you tell them you know ""/."
846,price group one and two are the cheapest .
847,you're gonna use maybe fifty five percent thirty five percent of that .
848,and then the most expensive one group four you use five percent .
849,so I have to make sure that what I'm using has been assigned to the bathroom in that percentage .
850,you know how long ..?
851,I mean it takes a lot .
852,and then in addition to that /.
853,yeah .
854,I have to coordinate that with flooring and you know the other interior finishes .
855,I mean there's a lot of work .
856,and I started sketching and this and that .
857,"so when I told my boss I'm like ""/."
858,I'm sorry look I know it's taking a long time it's like I'm just you know lollygagging .
859,"but she said ""/."
860,no no .
861,"she's like ""/."
862,I'm not questioning your you know just whatever .
863,but I wanna get them right once .
864,because thank god when we submitted the drawings we didn't ask like the tile yet .
865,mhm .
866,what we were gonna price out in the contractor didn't price it .
867,so now when we're submitting these new drawings the work is coming out more expensive now .
868,but it wasn't our fault .
869,it was that he ...
870,mhm .
871,he didn't bid it correctly .
872,"so the contractor comes to us and he's like ""/."
873,oh you know you guys use this and that .
874,"and I'm like ""/."
875,no !
876,"and I stopped him right then and there and I printed out all the drawings and I'm like ""/."
877,I know what I did .
878,I worked on this for a month and a half .
879,you know I know I mean I ...
880,yeah .
881,memorized the color line and the numbers and everything it's you know .
882,.
883,and at the end we were right .
884,"so I'm like ""/."
885,I'm glad that I took so much time to do that .
886,because now at the end it avoids error .
887,do they expect us ...
888,I mean no I mean we pulled it off I don't know how .
889,did you think like projects en un día ?
890,Lauren .
891,and then ...
892,but I told her I'm like .
893,te quieren tener como los chinos eh ?
894,yeah we're like a little sweatshop !
895,the other day the AC was messed up .
896,it's messed up .
897,and I dunno when they're gonna fix it .
898,in your building ?
899,in our office .
900,all right .
901,"we were like ""/."
902,todos estamos con un calor and working .

904,"and we're like ""/."

937,they were from Taiwan .
938,the father did that .
939,he did it he was in the tennis shoes business .

949,and he used to get my dad like tennis shoes y todo to play tennis .
950,uhhuh .
951,it's like it's the same thing .
952,"he's like ""/."
953,la única cosa es que no te pagan .
954,no tienes que pagar mucho porque no ...
955,you don't have the check .
956,no .
957,you know the Nike check on it .
958,you know what I did learn ?
959,.
960,I guess they have tests and stuff .
961,pero to test if like jewelry has like lead and stuff .
962,mhm .
963,they bang it against you know the floor or a surface .
964,a surface uhhuh .
965,and depending on el sonido .
966,uhhuh .
967,tiene lead or no .
968,and we were testing some things that we had bought from Chico's .
969,it was like forty five dollar you know bracelets and stuff like that .
970,and all of them had lead .
971,had lead ?
972,how can you tell the difference //.
973,like you compare two sounds ?
974,or you automatically know .
975,yeah .
976,like get one of your rings or something that's like gold or something or stainless steel .
977,like costume jewelry ?
978,something like that and just go like that .
979,mhm .
980,and get something you've bought .
981,and you you know something you wanna see if it has lead .
982,and it usually has like a heavier pounding sound .
983,and the other sound is very light .
984,so the lead is the heavier one obviously .
985,mhm .
986,and we tested it and .
987,"Maricarmen is like ""/."
988,let me see !
989,and she has like very nice ring .

996,and then we got one of the accessories that we had bought .
997,and she the same thing .
998,and you could hear .
999,like it's heavy sound .
1000,why do they use lead ?
1001,because it's a cheaper material ?
1002,anyway it's more ...
1003,what do they use in of that ?
1004,.
