290,and Roatan is one of the islands .
291,and I can't remember what the other two are called .
292,but we have a house in Roatan which is the biggest island .
293,and like on this side on like the left side of the island is all like hotels marinas .
294,like because it's huge on diving because like like here's Honduras .
295,and the islands are right here .
296,and like all of this like off the coast of Mexico and like Guatemala and stuff .
297,all of that is like the second largest coral reef formation in the world .
298,all of that .
299,what's it called ?
300,I can't remember .
301,but it like stretches all the way to Roatan like it ends over there .
302,some awesome fish in there huh .
303,oh my god yeah bro and like diving is .
304,that's where I went scuba diving for the first time .
305,my dad learned how to scuba dive from Jean_Michel_Cousteau .
306,oh yeah ?
307,Jean_Cousteau's son yeah .
308,he did his first night dive with him and everything .
309,they jumped out of a helicopter one time .
310,in a dive ?
311,into the water at night yeah .
312,when you you jump like that .
313,and the helicopter is like twenty feet above the water .
314,and you just jump ...
315,no way !
316,with full gear yeah .
317,full gear ?
318,yeah .
319,from like twice as high as this ...
320,and how do you get picked up ?
321,the ...
322,a lift ?
323,the helicopter comes down with a yeah .
324,what do you do ?
325,they have like a GPS on them or something for helicopters to find them at night time .
326,you put a buoy .
327,.
328,there's a buoy in certain spots .
329,and you have to come back to the buoy .
330,and he said you have under water like ten or fifteen feet under water .
331,there's a blinker that goes off on the buoy that you can see for like miles under water ...
332,for real ?
333,so you just have to like ...
334,because bro have you ever been night diving ?
335,no .
336,I've never been .
337,but my dad told me like it's the sickest craziest feeling ever .
338,because you can be be going down bro and you think you're going up .
339,you're going up yeah .
340,because you don't realize it .
341,so he says there's like a blinking ball just like a big light bulb .
342,and it just blinks and blinks and blinks like every two seconds .
343,so and you see it .
344,so and it's like ten fifteen feet under water .
345,so you just go back to that whenever your tank's almost out .
346,and the helicopter will come back .
347,damn .
348,yeah bro the craziest story I've ever heard .
349,my dad told me that when he was out there building the house because my dad was in Notre_Dame he it took him six years to graduate .
350,like the School_of_Architecture at Notre_Dame takes like four and a half to five years .
351,like it's a four year program .
352,uhuh .
353,but like if you don't like do summer and all that stuff like it usually takes people more than four years or whatever .
354,but it took my dad six years because he took a year off and moved to Roatan and built our house out there .
355,wow .
356,so he said that when he was out there bro it was like three or four o'clock one afternoon .
357,like they just got done working .
358,he just like grabbed a case of beer and went down to the dock and our dock .
359,remember I told you my uncle had that shrimping company ?
360,yeah .
361,my grandfather whatever .
362,yeah .
363,wow that's like a mile down .
364,like we own all that land all that side of the island .
365,my grandparents owned like the entirety of it .
366,like they've sold a lot of it now .
367,but we own like all of it so the thing's like a mile down .
368,and the water it's not like here the beach .
369,like it stays steady .
370,like it's a steady drop .
371,because it's like in a bay .
372,like the island's right here .
373,and there's a little island like a little island right here that used to be an air strip .
374,and then the coral reef is back here .
375,so the water goes deep really quick .
376,so the dock goes out like fifty feet because bro my grandfather used to have a fifty two foot yacht out there .
377,and the water is like a hundred feet deep at the end of the dock .
378,it's like a fifty foot dock .
379,so he said they were in there building the dock .
380,and they were done with like the first like twenty feet of the dock .
381,and he said that he saw a manta ray just like swimming bro .
382,he just saw it go under the dock like farther out and then come back .
383,and then he just said that he heard like a big bang .
384,and then he saw the dock like a piece of the dock fall into the water .
385,and he said that there was like a twelve foot hammerhead shark that was chasing the manta ray .
386,no way .
387,and he went underneath the docks .
388,and he broke the pilings there bro .
389,it was probably like thirty feet deep forty feet deep where he hit it .
390,and the pilings are big bro .
391,and he just said that he broke right through them .
392,and then they just kept going .
393,oh my god .
394,yeah bro .
395,that's insane man .
396,bro we're planning a trip to Honduras next summer .
397,we're definitely going out there for like a week .
398,well the only time I went diving was in a lake man .
399,no way how was that ?
400,it was crazy .
401,dark water ?
402,yeah man it was pretty scary .
403,it was kind of like the end of the winter so the water was still cold like it had been colder the days before .

405,and lake water is colder ...
406,it's cold yeah .
407,because it's like still water .
408,mhm .
409,so we went diving .
410,and it was like forty feet deep in the lake or a little bit more so ...

412,because there's something that falls in there .
413,yeah yeah .
414,a hundred years later it's still there .

416,no way how weird !
417,yeah it was weird .
418,that's creepy bro .
419,no there was like signs from the street .
420,I was scared I was gonna be bit by something man .
421,like the bottom of the the lake is not sand .
422,it's like this ...
423,like grass right ?
424,no it wasn't even grass man .
425,.
426,it was like a muck man .
427,nasty .
428,like when your hand hits it it will sink into the sand .
429,like mud .
430,yeah it was ...
431,nasty .
432,it was like nasty mud .
433,and there was like grass all over the place .
434,there was like a couple like bats swimming around .
435,it's a pretty big lake .
436,but it was so cold .
437,I wasn't wearing a wetsuit .
438,I got so cold that when I got out of the water my like extremities like my fingers tips ...
439,purple .
